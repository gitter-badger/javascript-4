# javascript
A bunch of code that I have been writing while practicing JavaScript
Cloned example from : https://github.com/scruffles/BootstrapModalPopover.git: into:modal_popover_sandbox
    The example above in modal_popover_sandbox would work by opening the index.html in a browser only if your have your browser
    configured to open local file without CORS exception:
    In MAC:
    open /Applications/Google\ Chrome.app --args --allow-file-access-from-files
Collected another example from : https://github.com/kartik-v/bootstrap-popover-x.git: into: bootstrap-popover-modal-example2
